(c     )  <C-L> = <C-Left> (Back WORD)
(c     )  <C-Y> = <C-Right> (Seems to equal forward WORD minus 1 character)

(  n  x)  a = v (Visual)   A = V (Visual line)

Legend:

( i    )  Insert mode
(  n   )  Normal mode
(   o  )  Operator pending
(    v )  Visual+Select mode
(     x)  Visual mode

## Steps
1. Install vim-mode-plus package in atom
2. From settings/code/vim-mode-plus/keymaps, modify the vim-mode-plus.cson (Caution: I don't know if this best practice!)
3. Replace the content from this repo vim-mode-plus.cson file to atom package file
4. Restart Atom
